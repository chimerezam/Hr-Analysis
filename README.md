Employee attrition is a significant concern for organizations, as it can lead to loss of talent, decreased productivity, and increased recruitment costs. This report aims to analyze the attrition trends within our organization and identify key factors contributing to employee turnover.
## Executive Summary:
The organization is experiencing significant employee attrition, with 237 employees leaving out of a total of 1470. The attrition rate is higher among males (17%) than females (14.80%). Singles have the highest attrition rate (25.53%), followed by married (12%) and divorced (10%) employees. The Sales department has the highest attrition rate (20.64%), and job satisfaction levels are relatively low. This report recommends targeted retention initiatives, leadership development programs, and improvements to job satisfaction.
